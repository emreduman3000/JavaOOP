//Cloneable interface :
// Cloneable interface is present in java.lang package.
// There is a method clone() in Object class.
// A class that implements the Cloneable interface indicates that it is legal for clone() method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
//Invoking Objectâ€™s clone method on an instance of the class that does not implement the Cloneable interface results in an exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown.
// By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone() method.
//Refer here for more details.
